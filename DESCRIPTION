Description: criticalpath package is an object oriented implementation of the 
    Critical Path Method (CPM) in R with R6 library. CPM is a method used to 
    estimate the minimum project duration and  determine the amount of scheduling 
    flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. The flexibility
    is in terms of early start, early finish, late start, late finish, total float and 
    free float. Beside, it permits to quantify the complexity of network diagram 
    through the analysis of topological indicators. Finally, it permits to change the 
    activities duration to perform what-if scenario analysis.
