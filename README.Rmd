# criticalpath

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of criticalpath is to calculate the project duration and to find its critical activities through application of Critical Path Method to activities and precedence relation between then.

## Installation

You can install the released version of criticalpath from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("criticalpath")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rubens2005/criticalpath")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(criticalpath)


  activities <- data.frame(
    id        = 1:17,
    name      = paste("a", as.character(1:17), sep=""),
    duration  = c(1,2,2,4,3,3,3,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1)
  )

  relations <- data.frame(
    from = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15),
    to   = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 16, 17, 16, 17, 16, 17, 16, 17)
  )

  schedule <- schedule_from_data_frame_R6(
    activities,
    relations,
    "Project 1: Cost Information System",
    "VANHOUCKE, Mario. Integrated project management and control: first comes the theory, then the practice. Gent: Springer, 2014, p. 6"
  )

  schedule$duration
  
  schedule$activities_as_data_frame()


```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
