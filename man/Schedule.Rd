\title{R6 Class Representing a Schedule}
\description{
This class is a representation of Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM).
PDM is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities
are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical
relationships to show the sequence in which the activities are to be performed.

A schedule has activities and relations data-frames. With this class,
it is possible to apply critical path method

\subsection{Method \code{new()}}{
Make a schedule with activities and relations between activities.
The method \code{Schedule$new(activities, relations)}
creates an schedule object from two data frames,
one containing activities lists and the other the precedence relations
between activities.
After creation, it is applied the Critical Path Method (CPM).

It is possible to create a empty schedule, without any activity or relation
with the constructor \code{Schedule$new()}.
After that, it is possible to add activity with \code{add_activity}
and relation with \code{add_relation} methods.
